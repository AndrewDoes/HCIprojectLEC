This project was my very first step into front‑end development during the Human‑Computer Interaction (HCI) course, Semester 2 at Bina Nusantara University. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it served as a learning exercise to grasp the fundamentals of web layout, styling, and interactivity.

⚠️ Disclaimer:
The application is not yet responsive; it’s optimized for a specific desktop resolution and may not render correctly on tablets or mobile devices.

Key Points
Tech stack: Pure HTML + CSS + JavaScript (no frameworks).

Purpose: Hands‑on exploration of basic front‑end concepts, DOM manipulation, and user‑interface design principles taught in the HCI course.

Current limitations: Fixed layout and styling tied to a single desktop viewport.

Future Improvements
Refactor the CSS with flexible units (rem, %, vw/vh) and media queries for full responsiveness.

Modularize the JavaScript and adopt modern ES6 syntax.

Explore a component‑based framework (e.g., React or Vue) after solidifying the fundamentals.

Feel free to clone, explore, and provide feedback as I continue to iterate and enhance the project.
